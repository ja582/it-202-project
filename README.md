# it-202-project


This is my final project for IT-202. The project is a Rock, Paper, Scissors game with wagering and leaderboards. 

Users can:
- Play Rock, Paper Scissors against a CPU
- Bet a custom amount in the game before playing
- If a user wins, they get double what they bet.
- If they lose, they lose their wager
- Semi-Japanese Language and English support
- leaderboards display the top 10 richest users

Admins can:
- Maniuplate earnings and change user's names
